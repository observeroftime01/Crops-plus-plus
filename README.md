### Attention: This is an unoffical fork.

Please go here for the original maintainers repo:

[GTNewHorizons](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Crops-plus-plus), which was forked from [bartimaeusnek](https://github.com/bartimaeusnek/crops-plus-plus). I do believe Bart is no longer actively maintaining his mod, so the GTNH Repo is the more more
up to date version. 

This version here will only work with my forks of [GT5u](https://github.com/observeroftime01/GT5-Unofficially-Unofficial), [Bartworks](https://github.com/observeroftime01/bartworks-unofficial) and the [GTNH CoreMod](https://github.com/observeroftime01/NewHorizonsCoreMod-Unofficial)

To Build:
Execute "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace", "gradlew setupDevWorkspace", "gradlew setupCIWorkspace", "gradlew build", the .jar will be in build/libs. Execute "gradlew Idea" to set up your IDEA workspace.



Below are offical release sources, I have nothing to do with these.
